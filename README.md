<h2> A dashboard for your kubernetes server </h2>
kubernetes is incredable for reliablility, high availibility, and more. 
Problem is that it is hard to use. Portainer makes it slighty better but its not perfect.
I made this to fix that. curently wip and nonfuctional but its on here anyways so anyone can contribute.
